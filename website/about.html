            <h1>Common Exercises</h1>

            <p>The following are common exercises that we encourage our
            clients to do as part of their daily exercise routine.</p>

            <dl>
                <dt>Burpee</dt>

                <dd>Burpee are a great, full body exercise to increase
                your strength and endurance. Begin in a standing position,
                drop into a squat and extend your hands forward, kick your
                feet back and then forward again quickly, and then jump up
                from a squatted position.</dd>

                <dt>Plank</dt>
                <dd>Planks build your core strength. To perform a plank, get
                in a push up position and rest your forearms on the floor.
                Hold the position as long as you can.</dd>

                <dt>Mountain Climber</dt>
                <dd>Mountain climbers are a good cardio exercise. Place
                your hand on the floor in a push up position, then bring one
                knee up to your chest and then switch as quickly as
                you can (as though you are climbing a mountain).</dd>
